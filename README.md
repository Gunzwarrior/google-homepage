I'm recreating the google-homepage as a project for The Odin Project.
It was my first guided project to build a web-page.
I used html, css, and the chrome devtools.
Learned a way to center stuff.
I used a css reset file.
I also used the git workflow.

Stuff I'm working on:

1. Do the search bar, glass icon, icons and searchbar placement, icons resize and searchbar invisible, resize all searchbar
2. Style and dispose the buttons beneath the searchbar
3. Center the all search area
4. optional, resize or choose another image for the google logo
